## Project Title
**Energy Consumption Forecast of Operational Systems Based on the Adoption Rate of Autonomous Vehicles: Focusing on Power Consumption and Carbon Emissions**

## Team

- Hyunjun Han

## Background
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly integrated into urban systems, with Seoul aggressively adopting AV pilot services. However, the energy and environmental implications of large-scale AV deployment remain understudied.

## Objectives
1. Quantitatively estimate the **power consumption and carbon emissions** according to AV adoption rates in Seoul.
2. Evaluate how AV-related systems (onboard computing, V2X communications, and data centers) impact urban energy infrastructure.
3. Provide **policy implications** for achieving sustainability and carbon neutrality.

## Research Questions
- How does increasing AV adoption affect total electricity demand in Seoul?
- Does AV adoption contribute to carbon emission reductions, or might it paradoxically increase emissions?

## Methodology
- **Scenario Modeling**: Simulate energy consumption and emissions from 0% to 100% AV adoption.
- **Component-Based Estimation**:
  - Onboard computing: 2.5 kW per AV
  - V2X communication (OBU): 5W per AV
  - Data center usage: 9.2 kW per AV
- Use **VKT (Vehicle Kilometers Traveled)** and average speed (23 km/h → 32 km/h with AVs) for simulation.
- Carbon emissions are estimated based on current and projected energy mixes.

## Key Findings
- **Traffic Efficiency**: AV adoption improves traffic flow (average speed ↑), reducing congestion.
- **Power Demand Surge**: Full AV deployment may require up to 23,000 GWh annually, exceeding Seoul’s projected supply capacity (16,221 GWh by 2040).
- **Carbon Emission Paradox**: Despite fewer gasoline cars, total carbon emissions may increase due to high electricity demand from computing and data centers.
- **Emission Peak**: Carbon emissions peak at 60–70% AV adoption rate, indicating a non-linear relationship.

## Policy Implications
- Improve energy efficiency of onboard AV systems and data centers.
- Expand renewable energy and revise urban power infrastructure plans.
- Coordinate **transportation, energy, and environmental policies** for balanced growth.
- Prepare for secondary effects like induced demand (longer travel distances due to convenience).

## Contribution
This study bridges the gap between smart mobility and sustainable urban planning. By modeling AV impacts holistically, it provides concrete data for shaping energy and carbon neutrality policies.
